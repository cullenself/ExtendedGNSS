# Todo:

- Project Management
    - [ ] Refactor Entire Project
        - [ ] Folders (code, config, data, output)
        - [ ] Single data process script that outputs data file
    - [ ] Documentation
        - [ ] File Headers
        - [ ] Where configuration numbers come from
        - [ ] Readme
    - [ ] Tests of Functions
    
- Added Features
    - [ ] More SV lookups (maybe process slides with script?)
    - [ ] DOP and skyplot
    - [ ] Model Actual Sat
        - [ ] Constant params
        - [ ] Pointing model
        - [ ] Offbore gain model
        - [ ] Orbit Propagation
    - [ ] Dead Areas due to geometry
    - [ ] Find and reproduce actual smallsat data (possibly GRACE?)
    - [ ] Determine optimal antenna orientation as function of gain pattern
    - [ ] Compare to other navigational methods
    - [ ] Increase SV Yaw Model accuracy with many HOTs in coordinate transformations
